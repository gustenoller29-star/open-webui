TROUBLESHOOTING.md:
   7: - **How it Works**: Lunarno is designed to interact with the Ollama API through a specific route. When a request is made from the WebUI to Ollama, it is not directly sent to the Ollama API. Initially, the request is sent to the Lunarno backend via `/ollama` route. From there, the backend is responsible for forwarding the request to the Ollama API. This forwarding is accomplished by using the route specified in the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` environment variable. Therefore, a request made to `/ollama` in the WebUI is effectively the same as making a request to `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in the backend. For instance, a request to `/ollama/api/tags` in the WebUI is equivalent to `OLLAMA_BASE_URL/api/tags` in the backend.
  13: If you're experiencing connection issues, it’s often due to the WebUI docker container not being able to reach the Ollama server at 127.0.0.1:11434 (host.docker.internal:11434) inside the container . Use the `--network=host` flag in your docker command to resolve this. Note that the port changes from 3000 to 8080, resulting in the link: `http://localhost:8080`.
  18: docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main

  167:         Thank you for contributing to Open WebUI!

.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yaml:
  11:         Please check the [Issues](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions) to see if a similar request has been posted.
  19:         - Open WebUI is a **volunteer-driven project**
  27:         If you encounter an issue, we highly encourage you to submit a pull request or fork the project. We actively work to prevent contributor burnout to maintain the quality and continuity of Open WebUI.
  30:         If a bug cannot be reproduced with a `:main` or `:dev` Docker setup, or a `pip install` with Python 3.11, it may require additional help from the community. In such cases, we will move it to the "[issues](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/categories/issues)" Discussions section due to our limited resources. We encourage the community to assist with these issues. Remember, it’s not that the issue doesn’t exist; we need your help!

docs/apache.md:
    5: # Open WebUI Configuration
  203: Thanks for making open-webui your UI Choice for AI!
  205: This doc is made by **Bob Reyes**, your **Open-WebUI** fan from the Philippines.

docs/CONTRIBUTING.md:
   1: # Contributing to Open WebUI
   5: Your interest in contributing to Open WebUI is greatly appreciated. This document is here to guide you through the process, ensuring your contributions enhance the project effectively. Let's make Open WebUI even better, together!
   9: ### 🦙 Ollama vs. Open WebUI
  11: It's crucial to distinguish between Ollama and Open WebUI:
  13: - **Open WebUI** focuses on providing an intuitive and responsive web interface for chat interactions.
  16: If your issue or contribution pertains directly to the core Ollama technology, please direct it to the appropriate [Ollama project repository](https://ollama.com/). Open WebUI's repository is dedicated to the web interface aspect only.
  20: Noticed something off? Have an idea? Check our [Issues tab](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues) to see if it's already been reported or suggested. If not, feel free to open a new issue. When reporting an issue, please follow our issue templates. These templates are designed to ensure that all necessary details are provided from the start, enabling us to address your concerns more efficiently.
  29: We've noticed an uptick in issues not directly related to Open WebUI but rather to the environment it's run in, especially Docker setups. While we strive to support Docker deployment, understanding Docker fundamentals is crucial for a smooth experience.
  31: - **Docker Deployment Support**: Open WebUI supports Docker deployment. Familiarity with Docker is assumed. For Docker basics, please refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).
  33: - **Advanced Configurations**: Setting up reverse proxies for HTTPS and managing Docker deployments requires foundational knowledge. There are numerous online resources available to learn these skills. Ensuring you have this knowledge will greatly enhance your experience with Open WebUI and similar projects.
  43: 1. Open a discussion regarding your ideas [here](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/new/choose).
  51: Help us make Open WebUI more accessible by improving documentation, writing tutorials, or creating guides on setting up and optimizing the web UI.
  55: Help us make Open WebUI available to a wider audience. In this section, we'll guide you through the process of adding new translations to the project.
  71: Your contributions, big or small, make a significant impact on Open WebUI. We're excited to see what you bring to the project!

docs/SECURITY.md:
   3: Our primary goal is to ensure the protection and confidentiality of sensitive data stored by users on open-webui.
  40: For immediate concerns or detailed reports that meet our guidelines, please create an issue in our [issue tracker](/open-webui/open-webui/issues) or contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5rJgQTnV4s).
